Welcome to the Const Tutorial!
Prerequesites: Core C++ Intro

There are two ways to make constant variables:
const int x;
int const x;

Althouth both work, the standard for the programming industry is:
const int x, so stick to that

constant variables can only be set one time, and they can
never be changed. That is why they are called constant.
